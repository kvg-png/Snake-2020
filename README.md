# Snake Project 2020
This was my final project for my CSC111 class:)

This game is a recreation of the infamous snake game, but with a modern twist. 
The premise of the game is to make the snake as long as you can without dying, which can be achieved by hitting the walls or yourself.  

The snake moves around the gameboard and will change direction with the help of the arrow keys. 
Your goal is to steer the snake towards the VIRUS that appears randomly. 
The more VIRUS consumed, the longer it grows, but the more difficult it is to move. 

To begin playing, download or import the sys and pygame module, as this game requires it.
Additionally, some image and sound files were incorporated the to create the VIRUS and musical elements to the game. 

Hope you enjoy!
